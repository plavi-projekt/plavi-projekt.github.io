    h1: Dolphins and marine turtles are leaving the Adriatic Sea. </br> You can help them come back easily!
    h2: Do you want to know how? simply watch the video!
    p1: There is a fine line between enjoying dolphin watching, with minimal or no impact on their behaviour, and causing severe disturbance while chasing them around. It is all too easy to step over this line if you are not careful and observant. 
    p2: There is a fine line between enjoying dolphin watching, with minimal or no impact on their behaviour, and causing severe disturbance while chasing them around. It is all too easy to step over this line if you are not careful and observant. 
    p3: By approaching dolphins in the wild, we are creating a disturbance in their routine. A significant increase in boat traffic in Croatian near-shore waters has taken place. It is known that persistent disturbance may cause long-term negative impacts such as stress related health issues, reduced reproductive success or avoidance of previously very important areas. 
    h3: What we choose to do when we encounter dolphins is going to make a huge difference to their well-being!
    rules: 
      head: Rules of behaviour
      st: It is paramount to be attentive to dolphin behaviour and to follow these simple guidelines:
      r1:
        title: INTRODUCE YOURSELF POLITELY
        short: Approach slowly from the side. Avoid sudden changes in speed and direction.
        long1: Putting your engine in gear, changing speed or direction is alarming for the dolphins, so try to be consistent. Approach them slowly at a speed less than 5 knots and let them get acquainted with the sound you are producing.
        long2: Initially, try not to get closer than 100 m, approaching from either side at a very sharp angle. Allowing some time for them to get comfortable with your presence also give you a chance to note if there are any small calves in the group. It is best you leave immediately if you see any.
      r2:
        title: FOLLOW IN PARALLEL TO THEIR COURSE
        short: Keep the engine in neutral while they are diving. Do not rush to reach them after they surface
        long1: It is best you maintain the boat in a parallel position and slightly behind the group. This way you leave enough room for the animals to change direction without constraints. Make sure you are aware of their movements at all times so you can respond appropriately. Avoid crossing their path or moving ahead of them.
        long2: While the animals are diving you can either maintain your current speed and direction or place the engine in neutral and wait for them to reappear. Do not rush to reach them when they surface. Follow the same routine as you would when approaching for the first time.
        fin: If there are dolphins approaching the boat do not make any changes until they leave.
      r3:
        title: DOLPHINS NEED PRIVACY, JUST LIKE US
        short: They will let you know if you are not welcome. 
        long1: Even if you are not an expert in bottlenose dolphin behaviour, most of the time you will be able to determine whether your presence is disturbing the animals by making note of the following:
        long2: If you observe mothers with small calves, leave immediately because young animals are particularly vulnerable to stress. Females or the entire group will often try to position themselves between the calf and the boat in an attempt to shield the offspring. This is a definite sign you should move away.
        long3: Leave if you notice the group is repeatedly making abrupt changes in speed or direction, above or below water. 
        long4: Dolphins will undertake prolonged dives in order to “shake you off”, often surfacing far away from the initial position.
        long5: Move away if they are repeatedly swimming directly towards and away from the boat.
        long6: There are also more apparent ways of showing discontent. They can try to scare you away or warn you with loud exhalations and continuous tail slapping at the surface, as well as repeated breaching.
      r4:
        title: GIVE THEM SPACE
        short: Do not come closer than 50 m. Let them decide to approach you. If there are other boats around, increase the distance from the group.
        long1: Dolphins can be easily disturbed if you do not keep your distance. There is no strictly defined boundary. At all times, try not to come closer than 50 m unless the dolphins approach on their own.
        long2: If there are others boats actively viewing the animals, wait for them to leave before you come closer. There should not be more than three boats within 200 m of the group.
        long3: Surrounding them will create a feeling of entrapment and they will try to escape. All vessels should be on one side of the group, allowing them enough room to change course without obstruction.
      r5:
        title: DO NOT FEED THE DOLPHINS
